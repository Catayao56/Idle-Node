<PROGRAM_NAME> (https://github.com/Catayao56/<PROGRAM_NAME>.git)
is an open-source command-line messaging platform written in Python.
It is made by Ethical Hackers vs Noobs, or simply "EHVSN".

We made this project because we know if we made our own communication
system, we will gain REAL privacy. Unlike other chat/communication
platforms, by default, <PROGRAM_NAME> does not save conversations EVEN
IN YOUR OWN MACHINE. The comparison table in the next page lists some
features that <PROGRAM_NAME> has.
